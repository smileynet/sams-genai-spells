## Tutorials — The concepts behind the spells

Each spell applies an established concept from a real field. These tutorials explain the concept itself, where you already encounter it, and how the spell applies it.

| Tutorial | The concept |
|----------|-------------|
| [Idiomatic Code](tutorials/idiomatic.md) | Every language has canonical patterns — style guides, linters, and conventions that go beyond syntax |
| [The Socratic Method](tutorials/socratic.md) | Teaching through guided questions instead of answers — used in law schools, coaching, and pair programming |
| [Best Practices & Antipatterns](tutorials/bpap.md) | The do/don't format plus named antipatterns — engineering standards, security checklists, and trap analysis |
| [Progressive Disclosure](tutorials/progressive-disclosure.md) | Simple first, complexity on demand — the design principle behind phone settings, CLI help, and good docs |
| [Diataxis](tutorials/diataxis.md) | Four-quadrant documentation (tutorials, how-to, reference, explanation) — each type has a distinct job |
| [Task Graphs](tutorials/task-graph.md) | DAGs, topological sort, and critical paths — the same concepts behind build systems and package managers |

## Skill References — AI knowledge loaded by spells

These are reference documents loaded by spells during execution. They're written for AI assistants, not humans — but you're welcome to read them.
